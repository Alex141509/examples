        <h2>Materials and costs</h2>
        <p>I have ordered the Riverside paperback editions for each play at the campus bookstore (as Kindle or e-books they are only about one dollar apiece, or you can get them on Amazon for about three dollars apiece). No matter what version/vendor you go with, these books are very inexpensive (much less than the Norton or Bedford collections) and contain helpful glosses and illustrations.</p>

        <p>If you own a collection from a previous course that has comparable textual notes, use that. <strong>Do not print a copy of a full-text edition off the internet.</strong> They do not have glosses and will not be sufficient to help you understand the text well enough for the exams and writing assignments in this course.</p>

        <p>Required: Crowl, S. (2008). <cite>Shakespeare and Film: A Norton Guide.</cite> New York: Norton. ISBN 9780393927658</p>

        <p>Required: <cite>The Tempest</cite> (2015), Dirs. Aaron Posner and Teller, Chicago Shakespeare Theater, 9/8-11/8</p>

        <p>Provided you are under 35 years old or know someone who is and will buy tickets for you (and you book in advance), the price to see The Tempest is $20. More details to come later on.</p>

        <p>Other readings will be provided by me. They'll be available on the course website.</p>

        <h2>About the readings</h2>
        <p>The readings in this class are mandatory. You should consider them your homework. If you choose not to read or fall behind in your readings, it will be apparent and your performance in the course will suffer. Use your time management skills to keep up with the reading.</p>

        <p>Shakespeare requires <i>a great deal more time to read</i> than modern prose as you must read glosses of unfamiliar words and explanatory footnotes. You will also need to reread some passages a few times before they become clear to you, so plan your time accordingly.</p>

        <h2>Watching Films</h2>
        <p>Films, just like the readings, are your responsibility outside of class. There are due dates for watching the films on the course schedule, but you should always read the play first before watching so that you will spend your time analyzing the directorial choices and composition of the film rather than trying to follow the plot action.</p>

        <p>All required films are on reserve at Galvin Library. Simply go to the circulation desk on the first floor with the call number of the film (next to films on the above list) and you can check the film out to view in the library. There is a station to view films in the group study area, but you can also bring your laptop and headphones. If you want to watch in groups (I recommend this), <a href="http://library.iit.edu/groupstudy/">reserve a group study room</a> (you'll need a laptop to hook into the monitor in the rooms--you can borrow them from OTS in the library).</p>

        <p>If you have a Netflix DVD subscription, you can request the DVDs. Keep in mind, they have limited copies. If you need to watch the film right away and the library is closed, you can probably get most of these films at Facets Multimedia or a similar art house movie rental operation. Likewise, you can rent most of these films from Amazon or iTunes for five dollars or so.</p>

        <p>There are plenty of options for viewing these films at low or no cost, so don't spend your money on DVD copies, some of which can run upwards of $30. Likewise, do not download films from P2P file sharing sites, as that can result in serious consequences such as criminal charges and university disciplinary action if you use campus computing resources; besides, there are lots of ways to view the films legally.</p>
